- When changing an existing class (for example by renaming a column name) the add-migration command might create 
SQL statements that lead to data loss. In this case it is safer to override the generated code with something safer For example
instead of dropping a column and then adding a new one, it is advisable to rename the column by using a method or a SQL statement:

        public override void Up()
        {
            // The following generated code would be too dangerous
            // AddColumn("dbo.Courses", "Name", c => c.String(nullable:false));
            // Alternative: Sql("UPDATE Courses SET Name = Title");
            // DropColumn("dbo.Courses", "Title");
            RenameColumn("dbo.Courses", "Title", "Name");            
        }

		or:

        public override void Up()
        {
            // The following generated code would be too dangerous. We add a line in the middle
            AddColumn("dbo.Courses", "Name", c => c.String(nullable:false));
            Sql("UPDATE Courses SET Name = Title");
            DropColumn("dbo.Courses", "Title");        
        }

- Remember to update the Down method accordingly
