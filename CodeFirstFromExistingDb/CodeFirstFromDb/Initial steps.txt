How to use entity framework with the code first approach starting from an existing db:

- Create a blank project.
- Add a new item of type "ADO.NET Entity Data Model" to the project. Go through the whole configuration and ensure to select all the tables.
- This will create the entities and the DbContext
- Refactor the entities with care as appropriate
- Ensure that the connection string added in app.config is correct.

From now on it is possible to work in the code first fashion:
- In the package manager console you type "enable-migrations"
- For the first migration type in the package manager console "add-migration <migration name> -ignoreChanges -force" (This will create an empty migration)
- In the package manager console you type "update-database"
For each subsequent migration:
- In the package manager console you type "add-migration <Migration name>"
- In the package manager console you type "update-database"
